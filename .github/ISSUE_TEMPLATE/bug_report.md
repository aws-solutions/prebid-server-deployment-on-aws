To get the version of the solution, you can look at the description of the created CloudFormation stack. For example, "_(SO0021) - Video On Demand workflow with AWS Step Functions, MediaConvert, MediaPackage, S3, CloudFront and DynamoDB. Version **v5.0.0**_". If you have not yet installed the stack, or are unable to install due to a problem, you can find the version and solution ID in the template with a text editor. Open the .template file and search for `SOLUTION_VERSION` in the content. You will find several matches and they will all be the same value:

```json
    "Environment": {
      "Variables": {
        "SOLUTION_ID": "SO0248",
        "SOLUTION_VERSION": "v1.0.2"
      }
    },
```

This information is also provided in `source/infrastructure/cdk.json`:

```json
    "SOLUTION_ID": "SO0248",
    "SOLUTION_VERSION": "v1.0.2",
```
